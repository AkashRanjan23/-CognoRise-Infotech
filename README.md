## Revised Summary of Insights:

1. **Experience Levels:** Senior-level/Expert experience is most commonly required for Data Science jobs, with few positions available for Executive-level/Directors.

2. **Job Titles:** Common job titles in Data Science include Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineer.

3. **Employment Type:** Full-time positions are predominant in the Data Science field.

4. **Geographical Distribution:** While the United States has the highest number of Data Science employees and companies, Russia offers the highest average salary, followed closely by the United States.

5. **Trend with Experience:** Both the number of Data Science jobs and the salary tend to increase with years of experience.

6. **Company Size Impact:** Medium-sized and Large-sized companies tend to offer higher salaries compared to small-sized companies.

7. **Average Salary:** The average salary for Data Science jobs in USD is approximately $112,297.87.

8. **Data Types in the Dataset:** The dataset includes numerical data types such as work_year, salary, salary_in_usd, and remote_ratio.

9. **Correlation Analysis:** A heatmap analysis revealed correlations between numerical data types in the dataset.

10. **Geographical Salary Analysis:** A bar plot was used to visualize the average salary by location for the top 6 locations, showing Russia as the highest paying location.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the insights obtained from the analysis of the dataset.
